  <h1>Guessing Game</h1>
  <h2>Things this script does:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Instantiates a variable to keep track of the number of correct answers</li>
    <li>Instantiates an object for each of the three questions. Each object includes:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>The text of the question</li>
      <li>The correct answer to the question</li>
      <li>The answer submitted by the user</li>
      <li>Whether the submitted answer is correct (sorta unnecessary)</li>
      <li>The text to present if the question is answered correctly</li>
      <li>The text to present if the question was answered incorrectly</li>
    </ol>
    <li>The script then proceeds to, for each question via do...while loops</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Prompt the user for a response to the question, storing the response to the qN.submittedResponse variable</li>
      <li>Validate the user imput to a limited degree (i.e. ensure a yes or no was answered)</li>
      <li>If invalid input, ask again</li>
      <li> If valid input, determine if the response is corrent and increment the correct answer counter, if appropriate.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Once all three questions have been asked, the user is presented with an alert for each question telling them whether their response was correct or not. The text used is either qN.responseCorrect or qN.responseIncorrect.</li>
    <li>Finally, the user is presented with the total number of questions they answered correctly in the form of another alert.
  </ol>
  <h2>About me:</h2>
  <p>At this precise moment, I'm tired and hungry. As a matter of fact, I'm going to pause now to order a pizza.</p>
  <p>Okay&hellip; One odd fact, I love ellipses&hellip; Though, working in HTML may break me of that. Generally speaking, it's easy to bust out an &lt;option&gt;+; to create an ellipsis on a Mac. I'm not sure HTML character entities will ever become so second nature to me. We shall see.</p>
  <p>As I've mentioned elsewhere, I used to be a sysadmin. After a colorful educational career spanning three states that did <em>not</em> culminate in a degree, I moved to Washington and got a job as a Unix admin doing deployment and third tier support at AT&amp;T Wireless. Before long, I found myself working as a software development manager. </p>
  <p>Then, I decided to go back to school and get my BS degree. I went to Bastyr University and got a degree in navel gazing (Health Psychology&ndash;Psychology &amp; Spirituality, emphasis in mindfulness practices).</p>
  <p>From there, I worked my way through a Masters of Library and Information Science (emphases on medical librarianship, user experience, and information architecture) by working as a Linux admin (bare metal up through various content management systems) for UW's Health Sciences Library and the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.</p>
  <p>Now, disallusioned with the libraries I've worked for and with my 21 year old son largely out of the house, I'm looking for change. Specifically, I'm looking for a career that will allow me to be location independent; perhaps work from a boat. Not immediately, but a few years into the new career. There's more to it than that, but that's the gist of it. Plus, I'm still tired and hungry.</p>
